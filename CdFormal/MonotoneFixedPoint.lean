# Monotone Fixed Point Between Sub and Super-Fixed Points

A proved consequence of the Knaster-Tarski theorem: if `f` is a monotone
self-map on a complete lattice, and there exist `sub ≤ f sub` (sub-fixed point)
and `f super ≤ super` (super-fixed point) with `sub ≤ super`, then `f` has
a fixed point `x` with `sub ≤ x ∧ x ≤ super`.

This is the order-theoretic skeleton of the sub/super-solution method
(Amann 1976) used in nonlinear elliptic PDE theory. For the continuum problem the PDE content
(monotonicity of T, construction of sub/super-solutions, nontriviality) remains assumed in
`PDEInfra.monotone_iteration`. For the finite-graph problem it is proved in
`CdFormal.Graph.FixedPoint`, which applies `monotone_fixed_point_between` on an order interval.

## Main statements

- `OrderHom.nextFixed_le_of_le` — `nextFixed sub ≤ super` when `sub ≤ super`
  and `f super ≤ super`
- `monotone_fixed_point_between` — existence of a fixed point between
  sub and super-fixed points

/-- The least fixed point above a sub-fixed point is below any super-fixed
    point that dominates it. This bridges `nextFixed` and `prevFixed`.

    Proof: `nextFixed sub` is `lfp` of `(const sub ⊔ f)`. Since
    `(const sub ⊔ f)(super) = sub ⊔ f(super) ≤ sub ⊔ super = super`,
    `super` is a pre-fixed point, so `lfp ≤ super`. -/

/-- **Monotone fixed point between sub and super-fixed points.**

    If `f : α →o α` is monotone on a complete lattice, `sub ≤ f sub`,
    `f super ≤ super`, and `sub ≤ super`, then there exists a fixed point
    `x` with `sub ≤ x ∧ x ≤ super`.

    This is the order-theoretic core of the sub/super-solution method.
    The fixed point is `nextFixed sub`, the least fixed point ≥ sub. -/
